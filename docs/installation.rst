Installation
============

Normal installation
-------------------

We strongly recommend using a virtual environment so that the system
Python remains untouched.

You can create a ``conda`` virtual environment as follows:

.. code:: sh

   conda create --name quaccatoo-env python
   conda activate quaccatoo-env

**OR**

You can use a native Python venv (you'll need ``pip`` as well)

.. code:: sh

   python -m venv quaccatoo-env
   source quaccatoo-env/bin/activate

After the virtual environment has been setup,

.. code:: sh

   pip install quaccatoo

To check the installation, you can run

.. code:: sh

   pip show quaccatoo

.. note::
   QuaCCAToo is best optimized to run on GNU/Linux systems. More specifically, the ``parallel_map`` method from
   Qutip, which QuaCCAToo heavily relies on, does not work properly on Windows. This leads to severe slow downs
   in simulations and even crashes in some hardware. macOS machines have not been tested by us.

Development installation
------------------------

.. note::
   This section is applicable only if you want to hack on QuaCCAToo.

Once again, we strongly recommend using a virtual environment. Please set it up with any tool of your choice
(``uv`` / ``conda``/ ``venv``) before proceeding.

.. code:: sh

   git clone https://github.com/QISS-HZB/QuaCCAToo
   cd QuaCCAToo
   pip install -e '.[dev]'    #not the system pip
